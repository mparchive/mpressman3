29 March 2020: So, someone blocks you and you have how many accounts to still keep harassing them? You got put in jail because you're a racist. You stalk and harass people, don't act like your some victim because someone did exactly what you do to many people. Block means go away.

29 March 2020: About 15 of your followers have eaten shit since, so. Fair's fair. Everyone you interact with is checked out. And if they do something wrong... Twitter time....

29 March 2020: Go ahead and report, for "revenge." Like when you report someone, you think they're supposed to just leave you alone. When you're the most hateful racist on Twitter. Everyone you interact with, is checked out. If they like their account, they should avoid you.

7 April 2020: This is a self victimization stalker. They think they're a victim, when in fact, it's them. They don't see their stalking and harassing as bad. "Dey just gittin da trolls," or some other lame excuse. The self victimization stalker is always the first to use the word, "stalker." https://twitter.com/Tony02039868/status/1247369383107874816/photo/1

7 April 2020: You're on welfare. You spend all day on Twitter. From the minute you get up till the minute you go to bed. You really need to get a life. Get a job or something. Your job isn't Twitter all day.

7 April 2020: I don't know who all of them are, but who cares? You're losing. You stalk and harass people. Now, you don't like it when someone plays your game better than you.

7 April 2020: No, you just don't mind your own damn business. You think because you're a black that means you can be racist. Doesn't work that way. You blacks on Twitter are horrible racists. The White People aren't like this.

7 April 2020: @indigenoussista @Toby31005037 @Tony02039868 Go ahead and call!ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ There's nothing illegal. If there was, half of Twitter would be in jail, especially you. Go ahead. Then explain what you do while you're at it.

13 April 2020: @indigenoussista @TwitterSupport @Black62603797 So you've been keeping tabs on that person. That's called stalking. You're a stalker. Twitter is a public message board. No law against it. So, niggy, stop harassing that person. We know you blacks think you're victims. You play the victim to justify your violence and criminality 
https://web.archive.org/web/20200413011137/https://twitter.com/kinte_toby/status/1249505487910993921

13 April 2020: See, niggy, you're the stalker. This person never interacted with you. Blocked all of your accounts. You need help. See, you're a racist. Just because you don't like what others say, that doesn't make it ok for you to harass them. the blacks always play victim. Not White People
https://web.archive.org/web/20200413011430/https://twitter.com/kinte_toby/status/1249506121569767424

13 April 2020: Aww, that's too bad...

13 April 2020: That's because you're soulless mud people.

13 April 2020: Stop harassing White People, blacky. the blacks think their racism is okay, that they can just harass White People. you thought wrong.

13 April 2020: You've stalked so many People that you have no clue who doesn't like you. My Friend never did a thing to you except pass on a block list. That's how People know who you are. Stop stalking people, stalker.

13 April 2020: "Hey Twitter, I've been stalking this person and I don't like what they say, even though I'm a nasty, black racist." Fixed it for you.
