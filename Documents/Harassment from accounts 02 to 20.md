29 March 2020: So, someone blocks you and you have how many accounts to still keep harassing them? You got put in jail because you're a racist. You stalk and harass people, don't act like your some victim because someone did exactly what you do to many people. Block means go away.

29 March 2020: About 15 of your followers have eaten shit since, so. Fair's fair. Everyone you interact with is checked out. And if they do something wrong... Twitter time....
https://web.archive.org/web/20200329020436/https://twitter.com/Reggin42187513/status/1244063621891723265

29 March 2020: Go ahead and report, for "revenge." Like when you report someone, you think they're supposed to just leave you alone. When you're the most hateful racist on Twitter. Everyone you interact with, is checked out. If they like their account, they should avoid you.

7 April 2020: This is a self victimization stalker. They think they're a victim, when in fact, it's them. They don't see their stalking and harassing as bad. "Dey just gittin da trolls," or some other lame excuse. The self victimization stalker is always the first to use the word, "stalker." https://twitter.com/Tony02039868/status/1247369383107874816/photo/1

7 April 2020: You're on welfare. You spend all day on Twitter. From the minute you get up till the minute you go to bed. You really need to get a life. Get a job or something. Your job isn't Twitter all day.

13 April 2020: @indigenoussista @TwitterSupport @Black62603797 So you've been keeping tabs on that person. That's called stalking. You're a stalker. Twitter is a public message board. No law against it. So, niggy, stop harassing that person. We know you blacks think you're victims. You play the victim to justify your violence and criminality 
https://web.archive.org/web/20200413011137/https://twitter.com/kinte_toby/status/1249505487910993921

13 April 2020: See, niggy, you're the stalker. This person never interacted with you. Blocked all of your accounts. You need help. See, you're a racist. Just because you don't like what others say, that doesn't make it ok for you to harass them. the blacks always play victim. Not White People

(In response to KJ asking for help from Twitter Support:)
13 April 2020: You've stalked so many People that you have no clue who doesn't like you. My Friend never did a thing to you except pass on a block list. That's how People know who you are. Stop stalking people, stalker.

11 May 2020: Also, listing people like that and telling followers to harass them is targeted harassment. I think it's time to report her. She had 15 tweets removed for doing that before. She's a long time stalker.

12 May 2020: I can see it now; the stalker calls the cops. Starts explaining to the cops. "They have me blocked, but I can see what dey sayin with incognito mode! Dey say..." Cop interupts: "why are you using incognito mode to spy on someone who has never engaged you?"
https://web.archive.org/web/20200515025958/https://twitter.com/Jim45921203/status/1260028219236839426

12 May 2020: The stalker is lying and saying that you guys are making threats, when no one is. It says because I threaten to report it's followers for hate speech, that, that is a threat. Meanwhile, it reports everyone! This thing is crazy.

12 May 2020: So, what does it do? Stalks some more. Does this moron have any self awareness? It thinks it's a victim. I wish they would call the cops. That way, the cops could explain that it's the stalker. I encourage it. I really do. Call. Right now.

12 May 2020: It says, "just admit you hate blacks!" As you see it calling White People every racist name it can think of. Stating every racist trope and stereotype. Okay for me, but not for thee. I guess.

12 May 2020: When you start claiming you have all these, "stalkers," you need to look in the mirror. Harassing people for a reaction, then claiming you're a victim when they react, is called self victimization stalking.
https://web.archive.org/web/20200512214413/https://twitter.com/Jim45921203/status/1260056096514981889

12 May 2020: If there was anything against the law, you already did it. Go ahead, call the cops! You can't harass someone and then claim you're a victim. Stop harassing Us. Every time you copy a tweet and post it, you're stalking. You're the stalker.

12 May 2020: She uses three accounts to stalk people. Incognito mode. So now she doesn't like it when people won't leave her alone, and do stuff to get around the blocks. Just like she does.

15 May 2020: You're the stalker. Stop harassing my followers. So, you lie and say people are making threats, when they're not. You harass people and act like a victim. I'm no victim. I'm just giving you a good taste of your own medicine and you can't stand it. "My stalker.." LOLðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

15 May 2020: Look at you now. You can't shut up about it. You have no stalker. It's a public forum. You're harassing people and they're harassing you back. Is that simple enough for you?

15 May 2020: You're on a public forum. You're harassing every bit as much. There's no "cyber stalking" on a public forum. You're anonymous. There's no, "you." Don't like it? Go private. Which is the goal. Then, you can't harass people.

(Responding to another KJ post, KJ asking for help from Twitter support)
15 May 2020: @twitter there's a racist account @indigenoussista that targets and harasses people. It uses all kinds of hateful, racist names in its, 100% dedicated to racist hate, account. It thinks its racism is okay, but anyone who disagrees is a racist.

15 May 2020: Stop harassing people. Stop harassing people Look at this, every day. You harass someone just because you're a black racist who doesn't like White's.

22 May 2020: You joggers are mean, nasty, belligerent, hostile, full of scorn, narcissistic, selfish, violent, not good to others. Even when you're, "being nice," to each other, you're still nasty as snakes. You can tell by vernacular if someone is a black, just by how nasty they sound.

29 May 2020: This jogger I told you about is SO DUMB, that it spies on my account and it saw what I posted to you, (it's blocked), warning you to block them and to look for any violations if you come across them harassing you. Look at what it said! IT DOES THE SAME DAMN THING!
