Park in the fire lane, then get pissed when someone gets them a ticket. Acting like they didn't know they could park there! Like, nope. Everyone else wants to park far away from the building just so you can park next to the door...

In 90 years, there were a mere 4,000 lynchings. 1,000 of which were whites. That's their data, which is probably way wrong. Also, these were criminals that got it. Did they ever get someone wrong?

Black women never report rape because they're taught from a young age to protect the race, first. They defend their criminals everywhere else. Blks, disproportionately commit way more violent crimes. 82% of murderers in our county jail right now? Blk.

On the "wht people killing blk people, all da time, like Emmit Till, thousands of times a day," I read an article the other day. All this talk of lynchings? In 90 YEARS, there was 4,000, 3,400 blk.

Ever see black people congratulating one of their criminals being apprehended? Oh, if they're white, oh yeah. I could go on about this. They defend their criminals. Race first.

The natural and predictable outcome with you people is violence. The ghetto is violent. Filled with you people. Our neighborhoods are quiet. Safe.

They don't take into account that 13 do 52. You're a small part of the population, that terrorize cities with your ruthless criminality. I gave you real numbers.

The white community is the only one that condemns racism. Go to blk Twitter. Show me ONE thread of racist, blk hate that has ONE blk person saying it's wrong.

You don't have people walking around in my neighborhood with guns. It's a ghetto thing. It's going to sink him with the poor, minority "victims."

You love criminals. You're married to one. No one's buying this fake shit. You're happy about what happened. Just like all the BLM terrorists on Facebook and Twitter.

It's just not charged that way when a gang of them is beating the hell out of a wht person while they all let you know it's happening because they're white! They're violent.

Yet, they think it's supposed to be a fair fight between them and the cops. They say it should be one on one. (Imagine that!) And the cops shouldn't be allowed to use a gun. (Like them)

I can't believe that the Democrats will go along with the lie just to get votes. If there was ever an attempt to give them anything, there would be war. They're not owed a nickle.

They're owed NOTHING! You get a chance at life. That's all you get. No one owes you anything else. You can't hold me responsible for what a few private companies did 400 years ago.

You know how hunters track their prey by looking for signs that the animals were there? Like excrement, knocked down branches, remains of food they ate? Same thing w/the fellas. A full, fastfood bag. Thrown out for all to see.

They never pay a check that they can lie their way out of. I was a waiter. They ruin everyone's time when they go out. You can't serve your tables, they rudely demand constant service, of course, don't tip. Stay home.

I wonder where the mega trillions of amounts of data they record goes. Out to dinner? Try relaxing, with them hovering all over the restaurant, recording everything.

The largest city in that county, Akron, is pretty dark, but not close to being a chocolate city.  That's still a high number of them being there. Not high enough, though.

No way he apologizes to anyone. That's a bit much to ask from a narcissist like him. However, if Ben threw himba hospital pass, I wouldn't cry over it.

I used to smoke it, it's addictive. And yes, when the cops found some in my car, I GOT INTO TROUBLE! Not trying to make any blk kids angry, but it's not just them.

I asked her if she knew that when blk people scream, "No mayonnaise," when they order, it's because of their racism. So yes, wanting mayo is way too white! LOL!

Like giving a windfall of money to people who will just blow it on junk, will suddenly make them financially responsible and make them go out, get educated, get jobs, etc. Nope.

They think that you're supposed to suck up to someone that hates you for something you never did. It's 2020 folks. The "yo ancestors" shit is getting old.

Reparations! LOL! If they ever even speak about it in our government, I'll pay to have clips like this played on a loop for everyone to see.

Homeless people are homeless for many reasons, most of which are beyond the control of any amount of money. Chronically homeless are given places to live and they end up homeless again. Not a money issue.

The fact is, you can't say that money is owed to people who weren't slaves. In fact, you could never prove you'd be better off had it never happened. Even if you're poor, you live better than almost anyone else in the world.

Plenty of people don't smoke crack or get in trouble with the police.  That's the person's fault.  The point being, if you want to succeed, nothing's stopping you just because of your skin

If you're meant to be successful, you will be. Plenty of you have. Stop acting like you're owed money from people who didn't do anything. People lose their limbs and still succeed.

Even rape victims are told by their therapist, eventually, to get over it, to move on. By that statement, I could go find people that wronged my ancestors and sue their kids. Gotta get over it. We've had a black president.

You guys just did one in Seattle last wk. I told you already! Last school shooting was 2 yrs ago. You guys do this regularly! It's your country until it comes to things you don't like. Then you blame.

You picked cotton, worked on farms, made clothes. If your work was so vital, why did we still succeed after slavery? States that didn't have it? Very few owned slaves.

Who's commiting mass violence against whts? 90% of interracial violent crimes are blk on wht. You're violent. The natural and predictable outcome of any conflict with a blk person is violence

The chances of being the victim of "white supremacy" is slim and none. They're a few fools who join clubs and once in awhile have a march. However, your chances of being wht and getting seriously hurt or killed by a blk, just because you're wht is pretty good!

Unlike opioids, you can't do much for treatment. Wht people who smoke crack get the same treatment as blks. If there was a treatment for crack, they would do it.

Just covered it today on the podcast. White people often get more time.  You make these myths up as if they're true. Blks are the only one's profiting from pot in Illinois.

We're talking about the present, now! They're violent. They don't pick fights to "see who's tougher" or "kick someone's ass." No. They try to seriously hurt, maim or kill. Do you see wht people playing the knockout game? No.

"Dey picked da cotton, dey built the world!" They made some clothes! LOL! They're not getting any reparations. No American taxpayers are going to pay for something that a few private businesses engaged in hundreds of years ago.

They're better off, and probably wouldn't even be alive today, than if they had stayed in Africa. They enjoy a life people in Africa dream about. They're looking for handouts.

The country didn't get rich off slavery. They picked cotton, made some clothes. They're just "lookin fo a check!" No one alive has benefited from them. They're looking for freebies.

They don't even consider that you first need to commit a crime to be in prison. Like having a record is normal.

Try to accuse us of what they are, by bringing up, "yo ancestors." They were even more savage back then, too. This would be like us saying that they can't dance. Wht people are better dancers.

Funny how the fellas try to say we're violent, for stuff that may, or may not, have happened years ago. (They're the masters of tall tales to this day) They're like pack animals.

The serial killer with the most kills is blk. You believe ghetto lies. At least you admit you people aggressively attack the police. That's a good step towards progress.

They get pissed if you say anything about them wearing weaves! They say that's rayssiss! One lovely lady on here goes by, "the Akata w/the good hair." Her hair is nasty. By the way.

If he sees the guy with a gun, that's one thing. You can't say that you thought he might get a gun. Why not think he's gonna get a laser gun? Or a mortar? You're living in make believe.

He was still a threat.  He only got convicted because the judge thought He shouldn't have confronted  the lady illegally parking. But still, that dude had no right to shove him like that. It's her fault.

That they're victims, that they're not violent and many are criminals. Every time they post a video of "police brutality," it's simply a video of one of them picking a fight with the police.
* [17 January 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200117235110/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1218012550446616576): Of course. No one who works with the public likes them.

Like the Becky thing. We don't care, it doesn't bother us at all, as much as they want it to bother us when we call them Tyrone and Shaniqua. The latest one is calling us violent! LOL!

You meet them after they contact you. You can't just, "not see them," like you can if you're driving a cab. No one who works with the public likes having to deal with them.

From what I could see, she was giving the guy a hard time and proceeded to yell at the guy who tossed her. Even if you don't agree with them, you shut up. They're in charge, not you.  You have problems with authority.

You're blinded. No one's giving him a pass. They're studying him and his actions to see if there's a correlation.

I saw this tweet, though. "Suspected Hispanic white supremacist" attacks po lil black boy! Black man defends himself. Yeah, this guy's a real jerk. Black racist.

Of course, if they follow these two, they're racist. So, you keep branching off. Every page is the same. Black hate.

This happened in the heart of the ghetto. The only description given was he was between 25 and 35. We know he wasn't white... when they omit, or call them "teens." Guess who?

I knew I would, and did, meet some people I knew there. However, I would've been happy even if I didn't. A buddy was supposed to go with me, he had an emergency. Of course, it 1993.

But you have to follow rules. You can't have just any scumbag moving in. That's why there's rules. If you're violent, like most people who are like you, then no housing.

He still ran from the cops. Not innocent.

You people never took showers, ever. Your poor, fragile skin would get ashy. When I had to go to school with you people, same thing, you never showered after gym, you smelled vile.

If I behaved like that as a kid, my parents would've punished me. I guess maybe that's normal behavior for you people  though. Doesn't mean it's acceptable.

If hostility, being disrespectful, talking too loud, in inappropriate situations, beating people for no reason, etc,etc,etc makes you "special needs," then I guess they vet a prize.

If she even did. You people always claim this. Why is being violent always a natural and predictable outcome with you foljs?

For the first 15 years, or so, you never saw fellas there. Then, they decided to run the bus there. That was it. It died. They cover it up, saying that it was, "gangs of teens," and the usual shit.

They're doing what it takes to get certain areas out of Republican control. Democrats are a small, but very loud and politically motivated minority in the country.

No one can verify anything you say about your time there, so just going off of what we've seen of you that can be verified, we can assume you're lying and exaggerating. All to get paid.

No one wants their employees talking back to customers like that.  No matter what's said to them. It's called being professional. That's why they didn't stick up for the "loyal employee."

Every large grocer in Akron Ohio's urban areas has shut down due to theft. Dollar stores make .45 cents on the dollar, grocery stores about .23. They need to stop stealing.

If they didn't steal so much, there would be large grocery stores in urban areas. An article I read stated that dollar stores make about .45 on the dollar, grocery stores,.23. You can't take all the theft and make money.

Even on very racist blk Twitter threads, you say something about it to them, they call you racist, like they're allowed to be, or something. I call it "race realist=racist."

The kind of people who are constantly complaining about slavery and reparations? Who call blk people from Africa "dirty immigrants?" The BLM terrorist organization? Yes, they use terrorist tactics.

They don't have to deal with animals day to day, so, they live in a dream world. Where all the little fellas and lovely ladies are just innocent angels!

We're tired of it happening and them getting away with it and it not even being reported. They refuse to cover those violent people. So, we have to see it here.

Whenever you mention their awful violence, they come back with that lame, "but yo ancestors!" How about this; if every person, like me, can be held accountable for what my ancestors did, then can't we hold them accountable for crimes they didn't commit?

They're way worse than any white supremacist could ever be. They don't even have to hide too much. They're holding everything up. White racist groups are a thing of the past. A couple of rallies a year? Give me a break.

I couldn't care less about that. It's his racist support for the black identity extremist movement and BLM terrorist organization. They're hardcore anti white. Just like him. They say, "all he did wuz..."

They broke the peace agreement. Especially when racist Obama got in and empowered black identity extremism. He ruined years of progress. Invited BLM terrorists to the white house.

There's no reason to believe you weren't even more violent back then. So, you're seeing everything through a bunch of ghetto lies back then, too.

They're superstitious, they believe anything that pushes their narrative. Someone's violently resisting arrest? It's the cops fault. Supposed to just let them go when they all resist.

I did a count of violent crime at the county jail inmate roster and crunched all of the numbers for violent crime. Counted charges and faces. Despite only being 43% of inmates. 82% of murderers, 61% domestic violence 71% assault

But, since you believe the lie that it's whts, you try to change the subject of all the crime that blks do.

They're liberal. It doesn't get reported because no one cares about the victims and it's not a headline grabber. Mostly, it doesn't fit the liberal narrative.

I see that a lot. Like the 11 year old girl who was resisting a couple months ago. Telling the cops, "get off me!" Thugs, you're not in charge. The police are. Always fighting with the police. Resisting.

We aren't giving you free money that you don't deserve! 🤣 the Japanese could show actual damages to the affected people. You can't just say, "my people's wuz slaves," and get free money. You weren't a slave. The Japanese who got money were victims.

Against the constitution. You have to be able to show damages by the government, not by people, anyway. Your conspiracy theories that there's a racist government aren't true.

He doesn't even pass a basic smell test for being a good person, let alone, a bishop, or whatever. Doing this for attention isn't a Godly thing to do.

* [22 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191222130045/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1208685303654948865): First of all, it doesn't even sound real. Secondly, Trump has nothing to do with anything. If anything, it was Obama's black identity extremist movement that caused it.

* [22 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191222115549/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1208683466591809536): Me too.

* [21 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191221150213/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1208392097868455936): Look at those predators! Thugs! Electric chair!

The victim thinks they're coming to help. No, they're coming TO FINISH THE JOB! TO ROB THEM! TO BEAT THEM. Report that race... guess who?

I don't know one person who even watched one second of the proceedings, because they're lies that mean nothing in the Senate. As well, the bishop is a vile, awful creature.

This guy's not a Christian, either. He's vile, to say the least, and spends his days making angry rants. He does this for personal gain. So, he's your fake "bishop."
