* [21 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210321230602/https://twitter.com/bigger_johnson/status/1373772859017945092): You're big mad about being called out for your long known, anti-Asian, HATE, racism, and violence. You're mad because liberals always let you get away with hit. Obviously, you know you're guilty. A hit dog hollers...

What the fuck is wrong with the blacks? By your assumptions about White's, according to the video, you all fuck dead animals. So there. pic.twitter.com/jwmu0bqi5A
* [21 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210321224617/https://twitter.com/bigger_johnson/status/1373767907113598982): You obviously don't wash your toilet. I bet your house smells.
* [21 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210321224543/https://twitter.com/bigger_johnson/status/1373767773084598274): That's just a dumb statement. The blacks eat some nasty stuff, just like some White's. This comment is dumb.

We don't like being mugged and stolen from. Hearing conversations amongst two people, 10 blocks away. Yelling on your cell phones. Having to even smell your unwashed asses... Yeah. Stay the Hell away.

I've worked at them before. They run out of hot water, ALL THE TIME. So when you use it, remember, it was used by this guy before you. You think washing your hair as a joke, in a bleach clean toilet, is as gross as that? pic.twitter.com/VmgeXVmSGe
* [21 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210321223500/https://twitter.com/bigger_johnson/status/1373765050469642240): It's a joke.  There's nothing wrong with them. If you clean a toilet well, you can drink out of it, as gross as the idea is. You've put silverware in your mouth that has been in the most rotten of mouths, when you go to a restaurant. You hope they cleaned it.

It's up to it to stop all the White People on Twitter from calling out black hate and racism; on other blacks pages! The stalker is very lonely. I'm here for a little fun.

* [21 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210321064247/https://twitter.com/bigger_johnson/status/1373518818383966209): Look at the stalker. Taking screenshots of accounts that have it blocked.

Dylan Roof didn't resist arrest, and wasn't, "heavily armed," whatever that means. Because by that definition, your thug, drug dealer, Breonna Taylor, was, "heavily armed." Mike Brown would've been, "heavily armed," had he been successful in taking the cops gun! So stfu!

You only care when it's the rare exception of you being a victim of someone other than another one of you. Everyone comes out for you. You nasty creatures don't come out for anyone. So stfu.

Just like everything that comes out of your lying mouth. Last school shooting that wasn't done by you wasv3 years ago. He was a HISPANIC. Not White. Your inner city schools are shooting ranges. 75% of mass shooters are YOU! School's included!

The poor Asian community is the only one that is victimized by YOU more than they are their own people. The most hate crime committing group gets called out for Anti- Asian hate and violence. How does it respond? With more hate and violence.

Boy. 75% of all mass shooters come from your community, including school shooters! Last one a HISPANIC did was over 3 years ago! Look up how many inner city school shootings there are! You're VERY LOW IQ!

There's far more White People than blacks in America, so there's about 50% White People in prison. But 13 do 50, so that's why there's so many blacks in prison with them.

You commit hate crimes against Asians at a rate of 5,000 to 1! I'm actually happy Biden called out what we have known for years. You're the biggest perpetrators of all hate crimes! Only you go out, jumping people for fun, based on race.
* [20 March 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210320080408/https://twitter.com/bigger_johnson/status/1373183525889970179): Sorry, but it's time to charge the blacks, the biggest perpetrators of hate crimes, from here on out. They were wrote to coddle you and you ended up being worse than anyone else. Anti-Asian is just the start.

Wait till they learn this is just the beginning. Hopefully, a new crime bill, to stop all this crime, is in the works from Biden. "Two strikes."

Now, do organized, well supported by the blacks, blm terrorism. That's actually happening. This is one, dumb, comment.

Pointing out a few isolated cases here and there doesn't change the fact that the blacks have been committing hate crimes, at a higher rate than anyone else, since the beginning. It's time for them to be charged as well.

But no one ever accused you of being intelligent. Quite the opposite. Besides, the biggest danger to the country is black identity extremism. Not mythical, "White Supremacy."

He has a history of using fentanyl, especially right before he encounters the police. You know damn well, if a black guy was accused of killing a White guy, who was high on fentanyl, you'd be screaming from the rooftops. We'll see what happens.

Boy, you getting called out for your anti-Asian violence, has you big mad! You've been coddled by democrats. Now, they're outing you!

He was forcefully detained because he resisted arrest. Breonna Taylor was a drug dealing thug, who was with someone who used her as a human shield. Tamir Rice was menacing people with a gun.

Absolutely no self awareness! You try to find stuff that's not even racist and try to use it on others. For you to say this is just idiocy.
