* [17 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201217062536/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1339456695081299969): A few immigrant, Muslim doctors got together, pooled their resources,  and started a low income, free clinic for their people in Cleveland. In two years. The best the blacks can do is open a weave shop.

* [13 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201213054302/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1337996289800364032): This is based!! https://twitter.com/tensaikendo/status/1337864554844475392

Who cares if we don't drown our food with salt? They constantly try to say we smell, because THEY STINK and they know it. That's why they're obsessed with that one. They're unclean. Uncouth.
* [11 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201211131400/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1337384795505045505): Imagine thinking you're owed reparations. Owed for work you didn't do. That's engrained entitlement thinking.

Not one of their stories ever ends up being true.
* [10 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201210030615/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1336869348602949634): They're always raping and killing their kids. Time to go. https://trib.al/pTVLGS6

* [ 7 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201207023739/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1335774894940942336): Funny how the blacks think Twitter rules apply in real life. Like you're gonna get arrested for calling them N******.

Like Adam Corolla said, it's like smoking. At first, it was smoking sections. Then, just the bar. Then, outside. Now, 25 feet outside. Little by little.
* [ 4 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201204054101/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1334734386684694529): That's cool.

Then, they project that hate and say everyone hates them. They're the problem. Who wants to be around someone who hates everything, and  always angry? If slavery never happened, they'd still be that way. More feral.
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130002348/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1333204856853716992): Good idea!

* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130001736/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1333203349932486656): It sure doesn't seem like it.
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130001429/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1333202435368767489): Yeah, I noticed his narcissistic face has been on tv a lot.

You're all pretty masculine. You're jealous of White women. That's why you hate trans, black men so much. They're more feminine than you.
* [28 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128070813/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1332581980693819392): I don't know. He did break the law. He hurt a lot of people. We did learn a lot that we shouldn't have had to learn the way we did, from him. I'd hate to be making that decision.

I barely knew I was sick. I just didn't have an appetite. My doctor had me get a test for covid, which was negative, but all that mask wearing, playing keep away, couldn't keep me from catching a little bug.
* [28 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128070036/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1332580032577941505): I sure hope so!

Anything to resist, right? If he's gonna ste as l it, make him wait till June to get sworn in.

All I saw was gains in popularity. Not like when you saw people turn on Bush, etc. That never happened with Trump. This was stolen.

* [30 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201030043055/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1322033086868135936): Hey Sarah!!!

* [30 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201030042559/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1322031852778102788): Every time. https://twitter.com/RealWriteWinger/status/1321865566647246848

* [30 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201030042357/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1322031321372336128): Live off student loans, buy some weed, a car, jam some 18 inch subwoofers in it and buy the biggest rims he can find. Then, complain he owes too much in student loans and can't get a job.
* [30 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201030042125/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1322030787282280451): Hypersexual beasts.

Like when a White woman works with the public, and they like the blacks. The mental gymnastics they do, convincing themselves that it's not just blacks that treat everyone like shit.
* [28 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028041447/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1321304246776713216): Yeah, that's true.

* [28 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028041054/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1321303308930342919): Animals.

* [28 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028040332/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1321301416472924160): It looks evil. So, if it was the villain, yes.
* [28 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028040209/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1321301132728274946): Yes. As they should be.

* [25 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201025040339/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1320214338226032640): I love Judge Jeanine, but she needs to stop doing her opening statements as if people who don't like her, or are liberals, are watching. They're not. She's preaching to the choir. She doesn't need to do this. We get it.
* [25 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201025035938/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1320213341231632384): I know. I don't know how this happens. Maybe you're on a block list.
* [25 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201025035754/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1320212824367431680): I guess the blacks are rioting again, over a guy who had the police called on him for jumping on cars. He then failed to comply, resisted arrest, fought with the officer and pulled a gun on him. These are just stupid, racist, monsters. No one should take them seriously.
* [23 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201023004755/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1319440087554400257): Savages.

Not just the, "one mighty swing of the sword," one's. The gory, "hacked off with a butcher knife," one's. They're subhuman. How can someone do that?
* [19 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020064755/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1318081194421092352): Not tweeting too much, just finding my frens first! Starting over.
* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016111854/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317062359240839168): I know. All those tornado's. I still watch those videos on YouTube, all the time. I watch a lot of tornado videos. Usually, at least one a day. We had an EF1 go by the house last spring, so my interest is still pretty peaked.
* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016095053/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317040254319198209): That's one of my favorite tornados to study.

* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016093219/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317035582908936192): LOL! pic.twitter.com/BWhYi1cd8R

Everyone knows that they're not.
* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016092703/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317034245823627264): I think you can say, "Nigger." You just can't call someone, "Nigger."
* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016092255/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317033239035498497): It really pisses them off if you spell it lower case and capitalize the W in White. They FUME, when they see that. Sometimes, I redundantly say, "White People," and, "black people," many times in a tweet to them, just so they know it's on purpose.
* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016091933/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317032349692006400): No, black with a lower case b. Always lower case, as small as possible. Change your font, if you can. Make it invisible.
* [16 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201016091813/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1317032020388741121): Yep. That's one thing I'm so happy not to be. Cursed.
* [15 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201015030903/https://twitter.com/StinkyJogger/status/1316576565824835584): Just finding my frens! Getting it back together again!
