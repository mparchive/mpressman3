The stupidity is draining. They feel so inferior that all they can do is lash out with stupid insults, that have no basis in reality. Seeing the hate from the museum people has me doubting everyone of them I meet.

When reading the chart, it's not the total number of crimes committed that is what's being pointed out. It's the percentage comparative to the group's population. So one group consistently commits crime at twice the rate of their population. 51% for murder. pic.twitter.com/pC8AfwS2CU

* [21 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211021031559/https://twitter.com/museumwatch101/status/1451024373196918788): The blacks: "don't judge us all because of what a few do, because of our skin color!"  Also the blacks: judge everyone based solely on their skin color.

This happens all the time, kids trying to make guns look real and getting into it. https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/in-two-years-police-killed-86-people-brandishing-guns-that-look-real--but-arent/2016/12/18/ec005c3a-b025-11e6-be1c-8cec35b1ad25_story.html

Won't be long until vile hatred starts getting posted again. We take screenshots too.

Don't ever stop for gas in those neighborhoods. The most dangerous places on the planet. Always full of "people" that bring out their mob violence tendencies. This is why we need more prisons. Not less. pic.twitter.com/1E8izY7INy

He was benched behind Blaine Gabbert. That's why he had this temper tantrum. Never had anything to do with the police brutality myth until he got heat, then came up with his lame excuse. https://twitter.com/RzstProgramming/status/1447742258527326208

All they've been doing is run this story non-stop on NFL network. They live just to lie. https://twitter.com/notPFTbot/status/1447735618474176515

Like the ones that showed up on January 6th. Those fools are being investigated pretty hard. If anything, they look the other way on black militants. https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/1447345499716136962

Just like when they get their accounts suspended on here. Claim, "I was just standing up to White Supremacy!" No. Going on Twitter and saying White People are devil's with monkey blood, and lice, isn't doing anything. https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/1447344028199096320

It won't post the hate it wants to spread, but rather retweet others saying it, so it doesn't get in trouble. The stalker is seething because I keep getting all of those accounts suspended, so it can't freely post hate.
* [12 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211012021351/https://twitter.com/museumwatch101/status/1447742469123235847): Every hunter and we'll educated person knows this.

That's where low IQ and years of learning from old wives tales and conspiracy theories comes in. Animals always eat the organs first. Easiest to get to, soft, not hard to eat.
* [12 October 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211012012726/https://twitter.com/museumwatch101/status/1447726435725086723): I'm back suckers.

It was self defense, because they came to him, so he didn't get in any trouble. Moral of the story is that your grandest of intentions don't always work out. As Willie D. says, "life's a gamble."

They got the wrong guy, found out he was retired and independently wealthy, so they couldn't do much, get them fired, whatever. So they decided to go after the guy, "pull up." They attacked the guy

Telling you all the shit you want to hear, that they're only going after Trump supporters. When they're done with them, you're next, again. Sucker.

Your constant anti-White racism against other employees, being shitty employees, that constantly threaten to sue. Wanting to come to work looking like black panthers, getting mad when told to cut your nappy hair.

You smell like barn animals because you only bathe twice a month, because water makes your skin ashey. Your "hair" is especially stinky, especially when you keep your weave on for months.

Doesn't apply to us Humans, who yes, lived in caves, out of the elements, because we don't live outside, like dogs, the way you heathens did, before we taught you how to live inside. The cave thing isn't an insult. Tree monster🐒

You were living in trees, eating bananas, living outside, like dogs, when we found you. So yeah. Proud that Humans lived in caves, unlike you. Why savages think this is an insult is beyond me.

You're the blacks from southern African coast, who we found yelling, "Ooga booga"" at each other, running around, naked, living in trees and bushes, with no sign of intelligent life.

Because you do over 50% of all murder! And if we're 60% and you're only 13%, that means a lot of you are criminals. You should delete this. But you're too dumb to realize how dumb it makes you look.
