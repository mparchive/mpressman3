It only gives you the side of the story it wants you to hear. It's the stalker. Not the other guy.

Just like your buddy, the stalker, here.. Accuses everyone of doing exactly what she's doing, then plays victim. She keeps tabs on people. Creates many profiles to do so. She's a self victimization stalker.
* [ 4 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804065717/https://twitter.com/failure_black/status/1290542163592450048): Your buddy here has hours a day, to keep track of trolls, harassing and stalking people, but no time to work. Funny how you blacks like to project. You blacks always accuse White People of what you're doing, just like your stalker buddy here.
* [ 4 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200804065144/https://twitter.com/failure_black/status/1290540822681747462): It takes maybe a minute to make an account, unlike you, who spends 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, 10 tweets an hour, on here. Nice projection. It's you and your monkey faced buddy here that need to get a job. No way you work the way you're on here, your buddy, either.
