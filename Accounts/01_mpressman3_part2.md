And he's going to learn that the harder he tries to get them to like him, that hole is just going to get deeper. They see that as weakness. That's why you have to ignore them.

It's not like she's the first person to not call the cops, coming out of a bar, drunk.

Why not just be respectful, like normal people? See that a lot in your community. Probably explains the problems with law enforcement and authorities.

White people say you people get away with murder and they can't say anything. One problem is that wht people know when they're saying "hate speech," on Facebook. Blk people don't. Because hate is just their normal.

Obviously, he's not very influential, because only blk people know about him. So I guess his dumb books didn't do what he intended.

Now, there's a good article about a cop getting killed on one of your pages, everyone cheering like hyenas. Why don't you join them? You never see us post something and do that.

Nowhere near the savagery that happens the other way around. It was one on one. Other way around, it's all of them jumping him, trying to off him, stomping in him, smashing faces into the floor. Not violent enough.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108215511/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192919930917789701): Another black identity extremist talking point, racially charged. So, you're on your way to wiping us out? Nice thought for you, I guess. Real nice thing to dwell on.

Not at the rate the fellas do, or the savagery. All white people are evil white supremacist, every day. So they're allowed to beat the piss out of them. All of them. Making little white kids run for their lives.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108122205/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192778703891320834): Being started by you. You're not bad, you're like a 1 percenter, but most of the time? Mean, nasty, volitile...  I'll tempered, ready to fight. It's the savagery that needs to stop. Look at how mean you all get on here. Posting videos to make fun of people getting beat up.

I mean is the goal to just beat up every one of them to find the racists? Because you can go into a blk neighborhood and bend over backwards to be good to them, but it doesn't help. Still get beat up.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108113028/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192764568340254720): You people have been beating the piss out of people who did nothing for a long time. You take out your violent anger on anyone. Sorry, one video, please, of someone not blk beating the tar out of a woman just minding her own business. Anything.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108113249/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192763787780202497): These are old. Yes, people beat each other up. You have yet to post one video of the example I set. The blk girls ganging up on the wht girl and beating up her 5 year old brother. Videos like that, of wht folks. Grisley, brutal beatings. Head stomping, stuff we see every day.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108093606/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192736142308921345): Ughh...  I'm talking about violence in general. You're always going to have criminals. However, you don't see whites beating the piss out of people, in such savage ways. Blk folks pick fights for no reason but entertainment.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108091438/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192729840937578496): Just like blks blame whites? This is one crime from years ago. One video of a gang of whts beating the piss out of someone for fun. Like we post.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108091629/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192729427920199681): You've been violent since you got here. There's no retaliation! You're violent every day! Video after video. You don't see the wht people doing that. Don't post a random crime. Post one video of a bunch of wht guys beating the piss out of someone. I'll wait.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108090904/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192728315532058624): This is over a year old. There's new videos every day documenting blk on white/Asian violence. Second, one video of a brutal attack like the ones blks do. One. You can't find it. All the malls destroyed by the mobs. The vicious beatings. This is the lifestyle.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108085347/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192726412748300288): Well, they did and it wasn't any of that. Cold blooded murderer will go to prison.

It says there's been a bunch of murders, but only states one. No mention of any other's. You folks beat whites all day, 100's of times a day. The media doesn't have time to report them all.

* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191109044755/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1193026039515111424): You're delusional. Black violence is a major problem in the here and now. Trying to push that crap about your ancestors is just an excuse for you to be violent towards others. Even if you were white, you'd still be a violent pos.

None of those people is appealing to the average person. All the media against Trump is so that when they fix it, they will fool uneducated, people not politically involved, into thinking he really lost because everyone hates him.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108061155/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192682845279576064): There's no law against being racist. However, as  you know, those people are the most racist people on earth. They say they're not and it's everyone else. Their hate is "allowed." Glad someone is calling them out.
* [ 8 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191108060437/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1192682196966019073): It's a trap. If you educate yourself and decide that living in a violent culture isn't for you, they call you these names. If you don't, you end up just like them, all following Tariq Nasheed and that racist bishop. Living a life of being a weak victim.

I just saw a tweet from a vicious black bishop who has his fingers on the pulse of the blk/liberal community. They hate him. Bad blk/police relations in his town. They don't like the gay thing, either. No black vote equals no nomination.

OBVIOUSLY, normal people know this is insane. But it's the people he needs that will abandon him and the Democrats. Black people are getting mad about illegals getting so much attention. Real mad.

He most likely won't be alive in two years, so it's just about getting a foot in the door so he can step down and they appoint who they really want in there. We need to get this out.

He's the local buffoon who was running for a local office here. He staged it. 3 days before the election, right outside his business.  Don't you think if it was real, they'd run? It's fake.

He staged it because he was running for a local office here. That's why no one believed it. Right outside his business? 3 days before the election? He's the local buffoon. We all know it was staged.

He was running for a local office here and this was about 3 days before the election. He's a buffoon. No one believed any of it. It was staged. Like the kids didn't run? Just happened to be outside his business? Brand new hats?

Whoever he would pick as VP is important, because he's not going to last four years and he knows it. It might just be a ploy to use his popularity to win, then step down immediately.

SHE TRIES TO JUSTIFY HER BAD BEHAVIOR BY POINTING TO SOMEONE ELSE'S BEHAVIOR. SOMEONE WHO WASN'T EVEN MENTIONED BY THE PERSON ATTACKING HER! HOW CHILDISH! GROW UP!

It's not going to look bad to a liberal viewer, however.

He has a DAMAGED heart full of stents. They went after President Trump for drinking too much diet soda. We should force him out

* [16 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191016050633/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1184326545101512704): You should see the libs. On an ana Navarro tweet, they savaged Gabbard. The far left lunatics hate her.

Every time she's attacked, she does it. About her hair? She goes after Pence. Yesterday, she brought Trump into it.
* [16 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191016044558/https://twitter.com/mpressman3/status/1184325284641812481): How the hell can he even be in the race? Even my ultra liberal mom, who is a Bernie supporter, says he's got to drop out after having that heart attack. They went after Trump for drinking too much diet soda. And now, they say NOTHING about this?
