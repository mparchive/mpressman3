Ron Harper was a great wing player that was given up on because of injuries. Now he's in the starting lineup at point guard. Then the bulls got kukoc who was the best Euro at the time. Jordan gets all the credit tho lol

It's all 90's nostalgia. When MJ retired the team still won 50+ games. The only teams that were good were the Sonics, Suns and jazz. rodman and kukoc made the bulls a loaded team. No team had their depth
