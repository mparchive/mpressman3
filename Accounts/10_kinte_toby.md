Blocked all of your accounts. You need help. See, you're a racist. Just because you don't like what others say, that doesn't make it ok for you to harass them. the blacks always play victim. Not White People

That's called stalking. You're a stalker. Twitter is a public message board. No law against it. So, niggy, stop harassing that person. We know you blacks think you're victims. You play the victim to justify your violence and criminality
