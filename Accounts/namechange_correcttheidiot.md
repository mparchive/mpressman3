Now you're making violent threats against someone just because you think it's one of my accounts. Maybe you shouldn't be the tree that leads to the most hateful accounts on Twitter. Your also an account reporter wanna be.

Mind your own business. All those accounts blocked you first. You're the stalker using incognito mode, making new accounts, etc, to stalk people. You just don't like it when it's done to you.

You're lying to get others engaged in your idiocy. The FBI takes threats seriously. Now that you're getting others to threaten people, you're the one making threats.

All stalkers have this thing that they're important. Like you. You're not. You have been stalking and gang stalking people on social media for a long time. People got sick of it.
