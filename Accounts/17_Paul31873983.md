It uses all kinds of hateful, racist names in its, 100% dedicated to racist hate, account. It thinks its racism is okay, but anyone who disagrees is a racist.

I can't take it when they give me a taste of my own medicine. I target people and try to get their accounts suspended, it's not fair when they do it to me!" Fixed it.

You're so ignorant that you don't even realize you're doing the same thing you accuse others of. You just don't like when it's you.

* [15 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515091104/https://twitter.com/Paul31873983/status/1261161507485896705): Just like you do White People? Well, used to. I changed your abusive behavior on here. I stopped you.
* [15 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515070724/https://twitter.com/Paul31873983/status/1261161298945019905): No one's breaking the law, stalker. Don't like people responding to you, you shouldn't harass them. Simple. But you're not smart enough to shut you're damn mouth and mind your own business.
* [15 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515094550/https://twitter.com/Paul31873983/status/1261159856226041861): See, sucks when someone you don't like is watching your account all the time, doesn't it? Just like you do to people. So, none of this, "muh stalker just made another account." You dumb jogger.

There's no "cyber stalking" on a public forum. You're anonymous. There's no, "you." Don't like it? Go private. Which is the goal. Then, you can't harass people.
* [15 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515064501/https://twitter.com/Paul31873983/status/1261157305019760640): Look at you now. You can't shut up about it. You have no stalker. It's a public forum. You're harassing people and they're harassing you back. Is that simple enough for you?
* [15 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515095210/https://twitter.com/Paul31873983/status/1261156957139992577): Those were abandoned accounts. You didn't do shit. Stop harassing people. You stalker. You've been stalking and harassing FOR A LONG TIME. This isn't new.
* [15 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200515051259/https://twitter.com/Paul31873983/status/1261156422621986817): Two BLACK football players arrested for ARMED ROBBERY today. Ben didn't rape anyone. Case was dismissed. Isn't that what you say when a black has a case dismissed? Vick was guilty. Went to jail. Besides, those cases have 0 in common. You're making a dumb, racist, argument.

So, you lie and say people are making threats, when they're not. You harass people and act like a victim. I'm no victim. I'm just giving you a good taste of your own medicine and you can't stand it. "My stalker.." LOLðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
