* [19 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200519053846/https://twitter.com/Jim45921203/status/1262618024013705216): I always call the cops on blacks. I don't care if it's a parking ticket.

You really think you have something, when you don't. No one wants your dirty, wire brush, hair. I grabbed a black girls couch one time. It was like grabbing sand paper, all that nasty, hard hair.

You don't know the concept of peacefully surrendering and going along. I have yet to see one video of you guys complying.

I've never seen a single video, that you blacks are all worked up over, that they're not fighting. That could've easily been avoided.

Even small things, like parking in fire lanes and handicap spots. They think they're entitled and all laws they don't like are just, "dumb laws." Let alone, the big things, like stealing and hurting others. That's why you hate cops

All the, "but White People's lips." And the dumb genetic lies don't change facts. We don't have a simian shelf and face structure. You're related.

They had every right to do what they did and to defend themselves when he tried to take their gun! It's sad, but he just cooperates, at worst, he's getting a probation violation.

That guy knew the cop because the cop busted him before. Cop knew he was on probation. Guy knew he couldn't escape because they knew his identity. So, he tried to take the gun to kill them.

The former officer, who knew him, and his record, had every right to stop and ask him questions. When instead of going back to jail, he opted to attack the officers son in an attempt to make an escape.

They're always a victim. So when one of them is schizo and has delusions that there's racists out to get him, so they shoot up a brewery, killing 5, they're still the victim. They see race. Not right and wrong.

There was a laundry soap brand, that had a picture of an alligator, chasing a black baby, saying, "it gets the coloreds out." In reference to clothes being dirty. It was a racist ad, but they never gave up babies to alligators!!!

You don't see the pregnant 13 year olds in the White community, like the black community. They have them when they're more capable of keeping them. Not as hypersexual. Able to control themselves better.

You shouldn't be allowed to have children. You should be castrated as birth control. Like slave days!

Look at how most of you turn out to be criminals and homeless. Also, thanks for reminding everyone who got the cave and who got the section 8, mud hut, back in the day.

You'll have sex with anything. Dogs, goats... Having it with your same sex is just another change of pace for you.

If the mouse living in your wall takes a dump, you got a video of it. Talk about recording crimes! White's almost never do it. This video was to show the self defense.

You don't understand why we have laws. You want crime to be the new black entitlement. "Just let us go! We can't comply with the law!" It's not the killing you're protesting; it's for chasing the criminal in the 1st place..

There's no "secret crimes" in White neighborhoods. They don't commit as much crime. Even the FBI data you people try to use to fudge the #'s shows that you murder more than any race.

They're common, everyday people fighting for rights, yours, too. They're peaceful. They're not dangerous thugs whose violent impulses can't be controlled. They don't destroy property and assault people, like Ferguson and Baltimore.
