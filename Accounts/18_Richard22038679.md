Claim it's another, "Tuskegee experiment." (When that happened, they weren't given syph, they already had it). They just weren't being treated. There was no treatment for syph. The experiment was to see if their treatment worked.

As Colin Flaherty says, with the jihadists, it's, "Allah akbar." With the blacks, it's the, "laughing" laughing, laughing." As they kill and maim, they laugh.

Black Caribbean's don't like you. Hispanics don't like you. White's don't like you. Asians don't like you. Yet, they all seem to do okay with each other. You don't do well with any, even yourselves. Maybe it's time to look in mirror.

You can tell, by the way about 75% of them tweet all day long, that they don't work. They sit around, on government assistance, killing time on Twitter, all day long. You see hundreds of tweets a day. They're not working.

I said, earlier, to defund all trauma centers in the ER's. Do these thugs work? No. Have insurance? No. Who pays the high expense of keeping these thugs alive? WE DO! THAT'S WHO! Defund them all, now. Let them fend for themselves.

That's why they're so obsessed with, what they call, "trolls." Every page, YouTube channel, etc, they're constantly trying to get rid of anything that shows the flaws in their thinking. Too stupid to debate.

If you want anyone to take you seriously, you have to forget Tamir Rice. He purposefully made a toy gun look real so he could threaten people. If you did that and robbed a bank, no one would be crying about some, "toy," gun. He was dumb. Dumb people die young.

The easily led, blacks, are just being used by democrats to gin them all up to vote. In the last year, a grand total of NINE unarmed blacks were killed by cops.

However, I shouldn't, because evil, soulless joggers, who have no empathy for anyone, don't feel bad when White People get killed. Their racist hate rules their world.

Blacks do 75% of mass shootings and the number of them shooting each other at ball games, in the hallways, etc, is far more common. Besides, that's not what we're talking about. You're going down a rabbit hole.

You try to put this off, because it makes you look so bad. Which is why you all try to deflect, by saying just what you said. What happens when you go outside means nothing, except when you get arrested.

Besides, calling out your hate and racism isn't trolling. You're a troll.

A lot of what they think is oppression isn't real and it's not skin color that makes some people judge them. It's their culture. People don't care what they look like, it's how many act.

When a black is down to, "y'all sunburn," they're losing the argument. Anyone, even you people, would trade using a little sunscreen over being you.

They're people who get paid very little, to police a group of people, who have no respect for the rule of law or authority, who give them a hard time, all day long. They get tired of it.

If a White Person doesn't succeed in life, he's some kind of loser.  If a black doesn't succeed in life, it's because they're black. Blacks need to realize that most people aren't super successful.

You guys just like to stretch what's considered to be innocent. Mike Brown viciously tried to take a cops gun after he had robbed a store. He wasn't even close to being an innocent victim.

The two senior citizens, the guys at the Coors plant. All funny, funny to you people. I'd almost feel sorry for Arbrery, but I cant. Not after what I see on here.

You can't win this. You guys always celebrate your way out of proportion savagery. Then, complain when one of you gets it. Unlike these people, who did nothing, your guys are criminally involved

Not one black on Twitter condemned it. They used debunked myths of racism to justify their support of the killer.

You see all these White Knights, all trying to help you, trying to ostracize any White's who are racist. Look at how many stick up for you. Now, look at how you behave. Posting one of you beating on a helpless, White, senior citizen. You all cheer. No condemnation

When I first learned of "Black Twitter," I didn't really care for you guys, anyway, but after seeing what you people think, I really have a low opinion of ALL of you, now. I no longer believe there may be some good one's. You're all vile racists.

We all get along and by the way, an organized state waging war isn't like mentally ill, deranged individuals attacking people in their own country. This is 2020. Not 500 years ago. Stop being so violent to everyone.

It's not. In the real world, you walk away. Like he eventually did. You don't thug out on them. You're representing a large company.

You're surprised? That's not how you act when you're representing a company. But you're so uncivilized, it's your normal.

You don't act like that when you're representing a company. We would expect to be fired for that. Not blacks. Nooooo. They justify their violence.
* [21 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200521081649/https://twitter.com/Richard22038679/status/1263383103059435523): Yeah, that's what you do. You don't represent a company and act like a thug. You go there after work? Have at it. On the clock, you act civilized.

So stop saying that the very few times that White People do something, it's racist, when you say nothing about massive, blk on White mob violence, way out of proportion.

Do you know he could've done WHAT HE ENDED UP DOING at any time? That's how you behave ON THE JOB, REPRESENTING A COMPANY! Not like a thug! So what? Even if the guy is wrong, you act appropriate.
