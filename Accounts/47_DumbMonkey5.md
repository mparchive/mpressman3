If it was meant to be an insurrection, it would've been. It was a rally, that we're still not sure who organized, that got out of hand.

You didn't earn it. Your ancestors did peasant work. There's 10 times as many of you, now. So that means you're owed nothing.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127082751/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354345269878521856): You're not owed anything.

* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127081614/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354342382129524736): You're owed nothing. There were 4 million blacks at the end of slavery. There's 40 million now. Even if the original 4 million were owed, and they weren't, that wouldn't go to 36 million who did nothing.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127081427/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354341918612844547): You're not owed a dime.

Saying from a severity point of view. He got some years in prison. This guy, at worst, would get 30 days in jail. They protect blacks.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127075047/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354335991453134849): She wasn't handcuffed. Did you even watch it? She was fighting the cop and got her ass kicked.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127074913/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354335547045646338): Trust me, we don't care.

And again, just like yesterday, no coverage in the mainstream media. The completion for protection. https://nypost.com/2021/01/25/teen-arrested-in-indianapolis-mass-murder/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&sr_share=facebook&utm_source=NYPFacebook&utm_campaign=SocialFlow

You only care because the female is black. You don't give a rat's ass when it's Kareem Hunt kicking a girl. Shut your black mouth until you know the facts!
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127044239/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354288596417720320): You're not owed reparations. None of you alive has ever been a slave. No one alive ever owned a slave.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127043949/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354287915476652034): You people are your own worst enemy. You're far and away, the most racist people on the planet. Then, all you do, is complain that no one likes you. You ever wonder why? Look at black Twitter. Look at how nasty and divisive this community is.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127043701/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354287248003489792): Ever see the way you treat them? Hell, the way you treat everyone?

* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127043225/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354286069353762816): Sorry, but they do the same thing for you. They deserve a fair trial. Just like OJ, the killer. I don't know why they don't want people to know that they're victims of the PC hit squad, though.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127042851/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354285179771215872): He has every right to a fair trial as anyone else. Not to mention, you only care because his girlfriend was black. I bet you said nothing when Kareem Hunt was kicking girls.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127041914/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354282632415215616): But they're not violent savages.

* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127041325/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354280966102142978): Oh, so you're in charge? No, you're not. Crime's not an entitlement for you! We make and enforce laws. You need to abide by them.
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127041058/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354280644784877568): Your community's the problem. None of you know how to interact with the police. You show videos and all of you are in sync, saying the perp did nothing wrong, when we're all looking at it saying, "what did they expect? That's resisting."
* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127040744/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354279836634796035): Pow!💥 pic.twitter.com/wvPad3f15g

* [27 January 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127040212/https://twitter.com/DumbMonkey5/status/1354278382121476103): This is why you're the problem.

You're community is extremely violent and dangerous. https://nypost.com/2021/01/26/four-young-girls-arrested-for-murder-at-louisiana-walmart/?sr_share=facebook&utm_medium=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPFacebook&utm_campaign=SocialFlow

This is just another day at the store. 13 year old murderers. https://nypost.com/2021/01/26/four-young-girls-arrested-for-murder-at-louisiana-walmart/?sr_share=facebook&utm_medium=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPFacebook&utm_campaign=SocialFlow

You need to be ready. They're 13 years old. Like the savages that stabbed Tessa Majors. Why did they bring them here? https://nypost.com/2021/01/26/four-young-girls-arrested-for-murder-at-louisiana-walmart/?sr_share=facebook&utm_medium=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPFacebook&utm_campaign=SocialFlow

The warrant was for her. She wasn't sleeping. They knocked and announced. Her boyfriend shot a cop, first. There's not one thing in this case that you people were telling the truth about. It wasn't murder. Justifiable shoot.
