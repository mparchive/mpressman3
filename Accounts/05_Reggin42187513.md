So, you just want crime to be the new black entitlement?  Basically. If I see anyone suspicious, I call the cops.  It's mass criminality, not mass incarceration.
* [29 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200329015259/https://twitter.com/Reggin42187513/status/1244073164646350848): What do you think? Hmmm. pic.twitter.com/UGMamn0HX9

If I want to call the cops on you, I will. You're not owed a fucking dime.  If you don't like white juries, don't commit crimes in their neighborhoods.  Easy peasy.
* [29 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200329013954/https://twitter.com/Reggin42187513/status/1244064721893982211): Nothing's worse than projection.

Like when you report someone, you think they're supposed to just leave you alone.  When you're the most hateful racist on Twitter.  Everyone you interact with, is checked out.  If they like their account, they should avoid you.

You got put in jail because you're a racist.  You stalk and harass people, don't act like your some victim because someone did exactly what you do to many people. Block means go away.
* [29 March 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200329013802/https://twitter.com/Reggin42187513/status/1244062006241525760): You're not owed a nickle.  You're not getting shit.
