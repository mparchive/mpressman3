### Progress:

* [Stalking and harassment tweets from accounts 2-10](https://github.com/mparchive/mpressman3/blob/main/Documents/Harassment%20from%20accounts%2002%20to%2010.txt) - Collected
* [Stalking and harassment tweets from accounts 11-20](https://github.com/mparchive/mpressman3/blob/main/Documents/Harassment%20from%20accounts%2011%20to%2020.txt) - Collected
* [Stalking and harassment tweets from accounts 64-70](https://github.com/mparchive/mpressman3/blob/main/Documents/Harassment%20from%20accounts%2064%20to%2070.txt) - Collected


* [Indecent tweets - CONTENT WARNING.](https://github.com/mparchive/mpressman3/blob/main/Documents/Indecent%20Content.txt) Work in progress.
  
  
Stalking and harassment tweets from accounts 21-63 incomplete.  
NOTE: the later accounts will have the more disturbing content on them.  
I'm not completely sure if grabbing content from every account in the middle is necessary for demonstrating the severity of the harassment, but the obscene tweets will be needed as they are a criminal offense.
